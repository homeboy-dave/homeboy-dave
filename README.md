## About Me

I am a Cybersecurity Analyst with a B.Sc. in Cybersecurity, skilled in penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and threat analysis. Hands-on experience with tools like Burp Suite, Wireshark, and Nmap, complemented by practical projects and CTFs that demonstrate strong problem-solving and offensive security skills.**. 

As a penetration testwer, I always find it intriguing how many website vulnerabilties are hidden in plain sight if not found immediately and remediated. This intrigue led me to the passion I explore today which is cybersecurity.

I frequently share my work online to educate my audience on what I do.
